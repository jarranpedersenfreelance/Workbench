# Mayaglyphs Webserver

## Introduction

This is the webserver made for the mayaglyphs.org site 

## Infrastucture

### AWS
This is meant to run on an AWS lightsail instance
The keypair for SSH access to the instance should be stored as PersonalServerKey.pem
After making the lightsail instance, assign it a static IP

### Nginx
In order to serve the webserver on the right port, Nginx is used
To install Nginx on the lightsail instance:
```
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install nginx -y
```
Then start it and enable it on boot
```
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```
Next open the configuration
```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```
Find the location/ block and edit it
```
# Example snippet inside the http or server block of nginx.conf (replace error stubs)
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name LIGHTSAIL_PUBLIC_IP;

    location / {
        # Pass all requests coming to port 80 to the Python server on 1500
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:1500; 

        # Headers for proxying
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```
Finally, test the new configuration and restart Nginx
```
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

## Deployment
Use the ./deploy.sh command to deploy the server both locally (for testing) and remotely
